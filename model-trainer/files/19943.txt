The DOJ has the right to monitor Microsoft's compliance during the6-1/2 year term of the consent decree. To become final, the consent decreemust be approved by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.Microsoft does not expect the consent decree with the DOJ to materially affectits OEM revenues.On March 17, 1988, Apple Computer, Inc. (Apple) brought suit against Microsoftand Hewlett-Packard Company for alleged copyright infringement in the U.S.District Court, Northern District of California. The complaint includedallegations that the visual displays of Microsoft Windows version 2.03 (andWindows version 3.0, which was added to the complaint later) infringed Apple'scopyrights and exceeded the scope of a 1985 Settlement Agreement betweenMicrosoft and Apple. The complaint sought to enjoin Microsoft from marketingMicrosoft Windows versions 2.03 and 3.0 or any derivative work based on Windows2.03 or 3.0 and from otherwise infringing Apple's copyrights and sought damagesresulting from the alleged infringement.The Company answered the complaint, raising affirmative defenses including itsclaim that the 1985 Settlement Agreement entitled it to use the visual displaysin question, denying Apple's allegations that the visual displays in MicrosoftWindows version 2.03 and 3.0 infringe any protectible right of Apple, andasserting counterclaims.On August 24, 1993, the Court entered final judgment dismissing all of Apple'sclaims. Apple appealed a number of the Court's decisions in the case to theNinth Circuit Court of Appeals, which on September 19, 1994 issued a decisionaffirming the rulings of the U.S. District Court.

The suit also alleges thatMicrosoft induced and continues to induce others, including Watermark Software,Inc., to infringe the Wang patents. Microsoft's OLE technology appears to bethe subject of Wang's allegations against Microsoft. The complaint seeks adetermination that Microsoft's alleged infringement is willful, an award oftreble damages, an award of attorneys' fees, and to preliminarily andpermanently enjoin Microsoft from continuing the alleged infringement. In itsanswer Microsoft denied that any of its products infringe the Wang patents andasked the Court for a declaratory judgment that those patents are invalid andunenforceable for failing to meet patent law requirements. The suit iscurrently in the early stages of discovery.Although there is no assurance that these lawsuits will be resolved favorablyand that the Company's financial condition will not be adversely affected, theCompany currently believes that resolution of these matters will not havematerial adverse effects on its financial condition as reported in theaccompanying financial statements. 5 8Item 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF fINANCIAL CONDITIONRESULTS OF OPERATIONSOVERVIEWMicrosoft Corporation develops, manufactures, markets, licenses, and supports awide range of software products, including operating systems for personalcomputers (PCs), workstations, and servers; business and consumer programs forproductivity, reference, education, and entertainment; and software developmenttools. The Company also markets personal computer books and hardware; and isengaged in the research and potential development of advanced technologysoftware products.REVENUESRevenues for the first quarter of fiscal 1995 increased 27% over revenues forthe first quarter of fiscal 1994.PRODUCT GROUPSSystems product group revenues are primarily from licenses of personaloperating systems and business systems with client-server architectures.Systems revenues were $444 million in the first quarter of 1995, compared to$355 million recorded in the same period of 1994, an increase of 25%. Revenuesgenerated by both Microsoft MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows operating systemsincreased from the prior year, particularly through the original equipmentmanufacturer channel. During the first quarter of 1995, more than 80% ofWindows units were licensed through the OEM channel.Applications product group revenues include licenses of desktop productivity,consumer, and developer programs. Applications revenues were $754 million inthe first quarter of 1995, increasing 31% from $577 million in the firstquarter of 1994. Increases in applications revenues were led by sales ofMicrosoft Office. Microsoft Office Standard includes Microsoft Excel,Microsoft Word, a Microsoft Mail license, and the Microsoft PowerPoint(R)presentation graphics program. Microsoft Office Professional for Windowsincludes all of the above plus the Microsoft Access(R) database managementprogram. Additionally, during the first quarter of 1995, the Company releasednew Macintosh-based versions of Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Word, and MicrosoftPowerPoint.The hardware product group's principal products are the Microsoft Mouse andBallPoint(R) mouse pointing devices. Hardware revenues were $49 million and$51 million in the first quarters of 1995 and 1994.SALES CHANNELSThe Company has four major channels of distribution: OEM; U.S. and Canada;Europe; and Other International. OEM channel revenues are license fees fromoriginal equipment manufacturers. Sales in the retail channels are primarilyto distributors and resellers.OEM revenues (primarily personal operating systems) grew 36% to $348 millionfrom the $255 million recorded in the comparable quarter of the prior year.MS-DOS continues to be pre-installed on many PCs sold by original equipmentmanufacturers. In addition, many major OEMs are also preinstalling theMicrosoft Windows operating system on PCs, leading to increased revenuesthrough the OEM channel.Revenues in the U.S. and Canada were $423 million in the first quarter of 1995compared to $328 million in 1994, an increase of 29%. Revenues in Europe were$289 million in the first quarter of 1995 compared to $274 million the prioryear. Other International channel revenues showed strong growth, increasing to$187 million in the first quarter of 1995 from $126 million in the firstquarter of 1994. Sales in Japan were particularly strong.The Company's operating results are affected by foreign exchange rates. Sincemuch of the Company's international manufacturing costs and operating expensesare also incurred in local currencies, the relative impact of exchange rates onnet income is less than on revenues.COST OF REVENUES, OPERATING EXPENSES, AND INCOME TAXESCost of revenues as a percentage of revenues was 14.9% in the first quarter of1995, compared to 16.2% in the first quarter of 1994. Contributing to thedecrease were greater sales of higher-margin Microsoft Office, lower diskprices, and a shift to more revenues from OEM and corporate license programs.While license programs carry lower per unit prices than retail versions shippedthough the finished goods channels, there is little cost of revenuesassociated with such programs. 6 9Research and development expenses increased 33% to $178 million, or 14.3% ofrevenues in the first quarter of 1995 from $134 million, or 13.6% of revenuesin the corresponding quarter of 1994. The increase in research and developmentexpenses resulted primarily from planned hiring of software developers andhigher levels of third-party development costs.Sales and marketing expenses increased 27% to $395 million from $312 million inthe comparable quarter. As a percentage of revenues, sales and marketingexpenses were 31.6% and 31.7% in the respective first quarters of 1995 and1994. The increase in absolute amounts of sales and marketing expenses wasprimarily due to increased marketing costs and headcount related expenses.General and administrative expenses were 4.1% of revenues in the first quarterof 1995 and 3.6% of revenues in the first quarter of 1994.Net interest income increased as a result of a larger investment portfoliogenerated by cash from operations combined with slightly higher interest rates.Other expense did not fluctuate significantly.The effective income tax rate was 33% in the first quarter of 1995, compared to34% in the same quarter of 1994.Net income for the third quarter of 1995 was $316 million. Net income as apercentage of revenues was 25.3% in the first quarter of 1995, compared with24.3% in the first quarter of 1994. The increase was the result of the highergross margin percentage and interest income offset by higher levels ofoperating expenses.FINANCIAL CONDITIONThe Company's cash and short-term investment portfolio totaled $3.8 billion atSeptember 30, 1994 and represented 67% of total assets. The portfolio isdiversified among security types, industries, and individual issuers. TheCompany's investments are investment grade and liquid. The portfolio, whileinvested predominantly in U.S. dollar denominated securities, also includesforeign currency positions in anticipation of continued internationalexpansion.Microsoft has no material long-term debt. The Company has available $70 millionof standby multicurrency lines of credit. These lines support foreign currencyhedging and international cash management. Stockholders' equity atSeptember 30, 1994 exceeded $4 billion.On October 28, 1994, Microsoft shareholders authorized the Company to issue upto 100 million shares of preferred stock, which may be used by the Company forany proper corporate purpose.Cash generated from operations has been sufficient to fund the Company'sinvestment in research and development activities and facilities expansion. Asthe Company grows, investments will continue in research and development inexisting and advanced areas of technology. The Company's cash will be used toacquire technology or to fund strategic ventures. Additions to property,plant, and equipment are expected to continue, including new facilities andcomputer systems for research and development; sales and marketing; productsupport; and administrative staff.The exercise of stock options by employees provides additional cash. Theseproceeds have funded the Company's open market stock repurchase program throughwhich Microsoft provides shares for stock option and stock purchase plans.This practice is continuing in 1995. Additionally, the Company enhanced itsstock repurchase program by selling put warrants. See Notes to FinancialStatements.Management believes existing cash and short-term investments together withfunds generated from operations should be sufficient to meet the Company'soperating requirements for the next 12 months. 7 10 Part II.

Interim results are not necessarily indicative ofresults for a full year. The information included in this Form 10-Q should beread in conjunction with the Management's Discussion and Analysis and financialstatements and notes thereto included in the Microsoft Corporation 1993 AnnualReport.Earnings Per ShareEarnings per share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number ofcommon shares outstanding plus the effect of outstanding stock options, usingthe treasury stock method.Agreement to MergeOn February 14, 1994, Microsoft announced its agreement to merge with SOFTIMAGEInc., a leading developer of high-performance 2D and 3D computer animation andvisualization software. Under the terms of the combination agreement,Microsoft will exchange approximately 1.6 million shares of its common stockfor all of the outstanding shares of SOFTIMAGE. It is anticipated thetransaction will be accounted for as a pooling of interests. Management doesnot expect the transaction to have a material financial effect on the Company'sfinancial results. The transaction is expected to be completed in late June1994.Stock SplitOn April 23, 1994, the Company's Board of Directors approved a two-for-onestock split, effective May 6, 1994. Share and per share amounts have not beenrestated for the upcoming stock split.ContingenciesOn March 17, 1988, Apple Computer, Inc. ("Apple") brought suit againstMicrosoft and Hewlett-Packard Company for alleged copyright infringement in theU.S. District Court, Northern District of California. The complaint includedallegations that the visual displays of Microsoft(R) Windows(TM) version 2.03infringed Apple's copyrights and exceeded the scope of a 1985 SettlementAgreement between Microsoft and Apple. The complaint sought to enjoinMicrosoft from marketing Microsoft Windows version 2.03 or any derivative workbased on Windows 2.03 and from otherwise infringing Apple's copyrights andsought damages resulting from the alleged infringement. The complaint alsoalleged that Microsoft was a contributory infringer as to a Hewlett-Packard(R)product called NewWave(TM).The Company answered the complaint, denying Apple's allegations that the visualdisplays in Microsoft Windows version 2.03 infringe any protectible right ofApple, raising affirmative defenses, asserting counterclaims, and seekingdamages in an unspecified amount resulting from Apple's actions.In a June 14, 1991 order, the Court permitted Apple to supplement its complaintto include Windows version 3.0 as an allegedly infringing work. Later in 1991,the Court dismissed Microsoft's counterclaim in which it alleged that Apple hadbreached an implied covenant not to sue for infringement as to any visualdisplays covered by the 1985 Agreement.On February 11, 1992, Microsoft disclosed Apple's written claim for $4.4billion as damages from Microsoft's alleged infringement of Apple's copyrights.Apple later amended this claim to $5.5 billion and more recently to $4.9billion. Microsoft considers Apple's damages claim to be insupportable underthe copyright law and speculative.On August 24, 1993, the Court entered final judgment dismissing all of Apple'sclaims. Apple has appealed a number of the Court's decisions in the case tothe Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Microsoft has cross-appealed the dismissalof its counterclaim and related issues. All briefing on the appeal andcross-appeal has been completed. The date on which oral argument will be heardon the appeal and cross-appeal has not yet been scheduled. 4 7In June 1990, Microsoft was notified that it was the subject of a nonpublicinvestigation being conducted by the staff of the Federal Trade Commission("Commission"). During further communications, the Company learned that thestaff wished to determine if Microsoft and the IBM Corporation had entered intoan alleged anticompetitive horizontal agreement that was purportedly reflectedin a joint press release issued at the COMDEX computer trade show in November1989. In April 1991, Microsoft learned that, apparently due to complaints fromthird parties, the staff had decided to broaden the investigation to examineallegations that the Company has monopolized or has attempted to monopolize themarket for operating systems, operating environments, computer software, andperipherals for personal computers. The Company produced documents, witnesses,and other information to the FTC staff in connection with the investigation.In a letter dated August 20, 1993, the Commission notified Microsoft that itsinvestigation had been closed.The Company was also notified on August 20, 1993 that the U.S. Department ofJustice had been granted clearance by the Commission to investigate Microsoft.That investigation is underway, and the Company is cooperating.On July 20, 1993, Microsoft was notified by the Commission of the EuropeanCommunities that the Directorate-General for Competition had received acomplaint from Novell, Inc. against Microsoft. The complaint claims thatcertain allegedly anti-competitive practices of Microsoft violated Articles 85and 86 of the EEC Treaty of Rome, and includes a request for interim measures.Microsoft is cooperating with the investigation of Novell's claims beingconducted by the Directorate-General for Competition.On January 25, 1993, Stac Electronics ("Stac") of Carlsbad, California, filedsuit against Microsoft in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, alleging thatMicrosoft's MS-DOS(R) version 6 operating system infringed two patents owned byStac relating to data compression techniques. Stac sought monetary relief andan injunction prohibiting the sale of products that include Microsoft'sDoubleSpace technology. Microsoft denied that its DoubleSpace technologyinfringed the Stac patents, and asked the Court to declare those patentsinvalid and unenforceable for failing to meet the patent law requirements.Microsoft also filed counterclaims alleging that Stac's Stacker(R) compressionproducts infringe a patent owned by Microsoft; that Stac engaged in unfaircompetition; and that Stac misappropriated Microsoft trade secrets relating toMicrosoft's proprietary technology for integrating data compression into theMS-DOS operating system.On November 15, 1993, Judge Edward Rafeedie denied Microsoft's motion forsummary adjudication that MS-DOS 6 does not infringe Stac's patents. The trialof the matter commenced on January 18, 1994, and on February 23, 1994 theseven-person jury returned a verdict ruling that Microsoft's MS-DOS 6 operatingsystem infringed the Stac patents and awarded Stac $120 million in compensatorydamages. Accordingly, Microsoft recorded a one-time charge of $120 million inits financial statements in the quarter ended March 31, 1994. The jurydetermined that the infringement was not willful. The jury also found thatStac had misappropriated and used in its Stacker products Microsoft's tradesecret pre-loading feature, and awarded Microsoft $13.7 million incompensatory and punitive damages.Stac filed a motion to permanently enjoin Microsoft from making, using,selling, licensing, offering for sale, or soliciting the sale of MS-DOS 6.0 andMS-DOS 6.2, and all other Microsoft products that include the compression ordecompression contained in MS-DOS 6, or otherwise infringing in any manner.Microsoft has opposed Stac's motion. In addition, within days of the juryverdict, Microsoft began to provide its OEM licensees manufacturing in, orshipping to the U.S., a version of MS-DOS that does not include thedisk-compression feature in question. On April 11, 1994 Microsoft also beganshipping in the U.S. the Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 6.21Upgrade, which provides the same functionality as the MS-DOS 6.2 Upgradewithout the DoubleSpace disk compression utility.Microsoft has filed a motion for a permanent injunction preventing Stac fromselling any product containing Microsoft's trade secret pre-loading feature.The hearing on both motions is scheduled to occur on May 13, 1994. Followingentry of the judgment in the case, Microsoft intends to move to overturn thepatent-infringement portion of the verdict or to seek a new trial. If thatmotion is not successful, Microsoft will appeal the judgment to the CircuitCourt of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, the federal appellate court thatreviews all patent appeals.Management currently believes that the resolution of these matters will nothave a material adverse financial effect on the Company. 5 8Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsResults of OperationsOverviewMicrosoft's business strategy emphasizes the development and sale of a broadline of software products, including operating systems for personal computers("PCs"), office machines, and personal information devices; applicationprograms; languages; and other hardware, book, and multimedia products.Revenues for the third quarter of fiscal 1994 increased 30% over revenues forthe third quarter of fiscal 1993. Revenues were $3.36 billion for the firstnine months of fiscal 1994, an increase of 24% over the comparable period ofthe prior year.Product GroupsOperating systems sales were $393 million in the third quarter of 1994,compared to $313 million recorded in the same period of 1993. Systems revenueswere $1.12 billion in the first nine months of 1994 compared to $854 million inthe first nine months of 1993, an increase of 31%. Revenues generated by bothMicrosoft MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows operating systems increased from theprior year, particularly through the original equipment manufacturer ("OEM")channel. During 1994, more than 80% of Windows units were sold through theOEM channel.Applications revenues were $798 million in the third quarter of 1994,increasing 33% from $600 million in the third quarter of 1993. For the firstthree quarters of 1994, applications revenues were $2.08 billion, compared to$1.68 billion in 1993. Increases in applications revenues were led by sales ofWindows-based products, particularly Microsoft Office. Microsoft OfficeStandard includes Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Word, a Microsoft Mail license,and the Microsoft PowerPoint(R) presentation graphics program. MicrosoftOffice Professional for Windows includes all of the above plus the MicrosoftAccess(R) database management program. During the third quarter of 1994, theCompany released new Windows-based versions of Microsoft Office Standard andMicrosoft Office Professional, which contained the latest editions of MicrosoftExcel and Microsoft PowerPoint.Hardware revenues were $53 million and $45 million in the third quarters of1994 and 1993. On a year-to-date basis, hardware revenues were $157 million in1994 and $176 million in 1993. The hardware product group's principal productsare the Microsoft Mouse and BallPoint(R) mouse pointing devices. Mouserevenues per unit are lower in the OEM channel than in the Company's retailchannels, and the percentage of mouse sales through the OEM channel increasedfrom the comparable quarter of the prior year.Sales ChannelsThe Company has four major channels of distribution: OEM; U.S. and Canada;Europe; and Other International. OEM channel revenues are license fees fromoriginal equipment manufacturers. Sales in the retail channels are primarilyto distributors and resellers.OEM revenues (primarily operating systems) grew 59% to $323 million from the$203 million recorded in the comparable quarter of the prior year. For thefirst three quarters of 1994, OEM revenues were $846 million, compared to $514million in the first three quarters of 1993. MS-DOS continues to bepre-installed on many PCs sold by original equipment manufacturers. Inaddition, many major OEMs are also preinstalling the Microsoft Windowsoperating system on PCs, leading to increased revenues through the OEM channel.Revenues in the U.S. and Canada were $381 million in the third quarter of 1994compared to $322 million in 1993. For the first three quarters of 1994,revenues were $1.13 billion, compared to $975 million in 1993.Revenues in Europe were $391 million in the third quarter of 1994 compared to$335 million the prior year. For the first three quarters, European revenueswere $989 million in 1994 and $963 million in 1993.Other International channel revenues showed strong growth, increasing to $149million in the third quarter of 1994 from $98 million in the third quarter of1993. Sales in Japan were particularly strong. On a year-to-date basis, OtherInternational channel revenues grew 48%, to $389 million in 1994 from $262million in 1993.The Company's operating results are affected by foreign exchange rates. Hadthe exchange rates in effect during the third quarter of the prior year been ineffect during the third quarter of 1994, translated revenues would have beenapproximately 2% higher in the third quarter of 1994. Since much of theCompany's international manufacturing costs and operating expenses are incurredin local currencies, the total impact of exchange rates on net income is lessthan on revenues. 6 9Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues decreased slightly to 16.7% inthe third quarter of 1994 from 16.8% in the third quarter of 1993. On ayear-to-date basis, cost of revenues was 16.4% in 1994 and 16.7% in 1993. Costof revenues varies with the channel mix and product mix within channels.Research and development expenses increased 34% to $156 million, or12.5% of revenues in the third quarter of 1994 from $116 million, or 12.1% ofrevenues in the corresponding quarter of 1993. For the first three quarters of1994, research and development expenses represented 13.1% of revenues, comparedto 12.2% in 1993. The increase in research and development expenses resultedprimarily from planned hiring of software developers and higher levels ofthird-party development costs.Sales and marketing expenses increased 15% to $359 million from $313 million inthe comparable quarter. As a percentage of revenues, sales and marketingexpenses were 28.9% and 32.7% in the respective third quarters of 1994 and 1993and 30.0% and 32.9% in the respective three quarters of 1994 and 1993. Theincrease in absolute amounts of sales and marketing expenses was primarily dueto increased marketing costs associated with the promotion of new products,particularly Microsoft Office.General and administrative expenses were 3.3% of revenues in the third quarterof 1994 and 3.1% of revenues in the third quarter of 1993.After a February 1994 jury verdict in the Stac Electronics lawsuit, the Companyrecorded a one-time charge of $120 million.Net interest income increased as a result of a larger investment portfoliogenerated by cash from operations, offset by lower interest rates. Otherexpense did not fluctuate significantly.The effective income tax rate was 33% in the third quarter of 1994, compared to32% in 1993, reflecting newly enacted U.S. income tax laws.Net income for the third quarter of 1994 was $256 million. Excluding theaforementioned one-time litigation charge, net income would have been $336million, a 38% increase over the $243 million in the corresponding quarter of1993. Net income as a percentage of revenues was 20.6% in the thirdquarter of 1994 (27.0% excluding the litigation charge), compared with 25.4% inthe third quarter of 1993. On a year to date basis, net income as a percent ofrevenues was 23.4% (25.7% excluding the litigation charge) in 1994 and25.4% in 1993.Financial ConditionThe Company's cash and short-term investment portfolio totaled $3.14 billion atMarch 31, 1994 and represented 64% of total assets. The portfolio isdiversified among security types, industry groups, and individual issuers. TheCompany's investments are investment grade and liquid. The portfolio, whileinvested predominantly in U.S. dollar denominated securities, also includesforeign currency positions in anticipation of continued internationalexpansion.Microsoft has no material long-term debt. The Company has available $70 millionof standby multicurrency lines of credit. These lines support foreign currencyhedging and international cash management. Stockholders' equity at March 31,1994 exceeded $4 billion.Cash generated from operations has been sufficient to fund the Company'sinvestment in research and development activities and facilities expansion. Asthe Company grows, investments will continue in research and development inexisting and advanced areas of technology. Cash may also be used to acquiretechnology or to fund strategic ventures. Additions to property, plant, andequipment are expected to continue, including new facilities and computersystems for research and development; sales and marketing; product support; andadministrative staff.The exercise of stock options by employees provides additional cash. Fundsreceived have been used to repurchase the Company's common stock on the openmarket to provide shares for stock option and stock purchase plans. Thispractice is continuing in 1994.Management believes existing cash and short-term investments together withfunds generated from operations should be sufficient to meet the Company'soperating requirements for the next 12 months. 7 10 Part II.

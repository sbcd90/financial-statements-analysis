MICROSOFT CORPORATION

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)

Basis of Presentation

In the opinion of management, the accompanying balance sheets and related
interim statements of income and cash flows include all adjustments necessary
for their fair presentation.  Interim results are not necessarily indicative of
results for a full year.  The information included in this Form 10-Q should be
read in conjunction with the Management's Discussion and Analysis and financial
statements and notes thereto included in the Microsoft Corporation 1993 Annual
Report.

Earnings Per Share

Earnings per share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding plus the effect of outstanding stock options, using
the treasury stock method.

Agreement to Merge

On February 14, 1994, Microsoft announced its agreement to merge with SOFTIMAGE
Inc., a leading developer of high-performance 2D and 3D computer animation and
visualization software.  Under the terms of the combination agreement,
Microsoft will exchange approximately 1.6 million shares of its common stock
for all of the outstanding shares of SOFTIMAGE.  It is anticipated the
transaction will be accounted for as a pooling of interests.  Management does
not expect the transaction to have a material financial effect on the Company's
financial results.  The transaction is expected to be completed in late June
1994.

Stock Split

On April 23, 1994, the Company's Board of Directors approved a two-for-one
stock split, effective May 6, 1994.  Share and per share amounts have not been
restated for the upcoming stock split.

Contingencies

On March 17, 1988, Apple Computer, Inc. ("Apple") brought suit against
Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard Company for alleged copyright infringement in the
U.S. District Court, Northern District of California.  The complaint included
allegations that the visual displays of Microsoft(R) Windows(TM) version 2.03
infringed Apple's copyrights and exceeded the scope of a 1985 Settlement
Agreement between Microsoft and Apple.  The complaint sought to enjoin
Microsoft from marketing Microsoft Windows version 2.03 or any derivative work
based on Windows 2.03 and from otherwise infringing Apple's copyrights and
sought damages resulting from the alleged infringement.  The complaint also
alleged that Microsoft was a contributory infringer as to a Hewlett-Packard(R)
product called NewWave(TM).

The Company answered the complaint, denying Apple's allegations that the visual
displays in Microsoft Windows version 2.03 infringe any protectible right of
Apple, raising affirmative defenses, asserting counterclaims, and seeking
damages in an unspecified amount resulting from Apple's actions.

In a June 14, 1991 order, the Court permitted Apple to supplement its complaint
to include Windows version 3.0 as an allegedly infringing work.  Later in 1991,
the Court dismissed Microsoft's counterclaim in which it alleged that Apple had
breached an implied covenant not to sue for infringement as to any visual
displays covered by the 1985 Agreement.

On February 11, 1992, Microsoft disclosed Apple's written claim for $4.4
billion as damages from Microsoft's alleged infringement of Apple's copyrights.
Apple later amended this claim to $5.5 billion and more recently to $4.9
billion.  Microsoft considers Apple's damages claim to be insupportable under
the copyright law and speculative.

On August 24, 1993, the Court entered final judgment dismissing all of Apple's
claims.  Apple has appealed a number of the Court's decisions in the case to
the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.  Microsoft has cross-appealed the dismissal
of its counterclaim and related issues.  All briefing on the appeal and
cross-appeal has been completed. The date on which oral argument will be heard
on the appeal and cross-appeal has not yet been scheduled.

In June 1990, Microsoft was notified that it was the subject of a nonpublic
investigation being conducted by the staff of the Federal Trade Commission
("Commission").  During further communications, the Company learned that the
staff wished to determine if Microsoft and the IBM Corporation had entered into
an alleged anticompetitive horizontal agreement that was purportedly reflected
in a joint press release issued at the COMDEX computer trade show in November
1989.  In April 1991, Microsoft learned that, apparently due to complaints from
third parties, the staff had decided to broaden the investigation to examine
allegations that the Company has monopolized or has attempted to monopolize the
market for operating systems, operating environments, computer software, and
peripherals for personal computers.  The Company produced documents, witnesses,
and other information to the FTC staff in connection with the investigation.

In a letter dated August 20, 1993, the Commission notified Microsoft that its
investigation had been closed.

The Company was also notified on August 20, 1993 that the U.S. Department of
Justice had been granted clearance by the Commission to investigate Microsoft.
That investigation is underway, and the Company is cooperating.

On July 20, 1993, Microsoft was notified by the Commission of the European
Communities that the Directorate-General for Competition had received a
complaint from Novell, Inc. against Microsoft.  The complaint claims that
certain allegedly anti-competitive practices of Microsoft violated Articles 85
and 86 of the EEC Treaty of Rome, and includes a request for interim measures.
Microsoft is cooperating with the investigation of Novell's claims being
conducted by the Directorate-General for Competition.

On January 25, 1993, Stac Electronics ("Stac") of Carlsbad, California, filed
suit against Microsoft in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, alleging that
Microsoft's MS-DOS(R) version 6 operating system infringed two patents owned by
Stac relating to data compression techniques.  Stac sought monetary relief and
an injunction prohibiting the sale of products that include Microsoft's
DoubleSpace technology.  Microsoft denied that its DoubleSpace technology
infringed the Stac patents, and asked the Court to declare those patents
invalid and unenforceable for failing to meet the patent law requirements.
Microsoft also filed counterclaims alleging that Stac's Stacker(R) compression
products infringe a patent owned by Microsoft; that Stac engaged in unfair
competition; and that Stac misappropriated Microsoft trade secrets relating to
Microsoft's proprietary technology for integrating data compression into the
MS-DOS operating system.

On November 15, 1993, Judge Edward Rafeedie denied Microsoft's motion for
summary adjudication that MS-DOS 6 does not infringe Stac's patents.  The trial
of the matter commenced on January 18, 1994, and on February 23, 1994 the
seven-person jury returned a verdict ruling that Microsoft's MS-DOS 6 operating
system infringed the Stac patents and awarded Stac $120 million in compensatory
damages.  Accordingly, Microsoft recorded a one-time charge of $120 million in
its financial statements in the quarter ended March 31, 1994.  The jury
determined that the infringement was not willful.  The jury also found that
Stac had misappropriated and used in its Stacker products Microsoft's trade
secret pre-loading feature, and awarded Microsoft $13.7 million in
compensatory and punitive damages.

Stac filed a motion to permanently enjoin Microsoft from making, using,
selling, licensing, offering for sale, or soliciting the sale of MS-DOS 6.0 and
MS-DOS 6.2, and all other Microsoft products that include the compression or
decompression contained in MS-DOS 6, or otherwise infringing in any manner.
Microsoft has opposed Stac's motion.  In addition, within days of the jury
verdict, Microsoft began to provide its OEM licensees manufacturing in, or
shipping to the U.S., a version of MS-DOS that does not include the
disk-compression feature in question.  On April 11, 1994 Microsoft also began
shipping in the U.S. the Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 6.21
Upgrade, which provides the same functionality as the MS-DOS 6.2 Upgrade
without the DoubleSpace disk compression utility.

Microsoft has filed a motion for a permanent injunction preventing Stac from
selling any product containing Microsoft's trade secret pre-loading feature.
The hearing on both motions is scheduled to occur on May 13, 1994.  Following
entry of the judgment in the case, Microsoft intends to move to overturn the
patent-infringement portion of the verdict or to seek a new trial.  If that
motion is not successful, Microsoft will appeal the judgment to the Circuit
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, the federal appellate court that
reviews all patent appeals.

Management currently believes that the resolution of these matters will not
have a material adverse financial effect on the Company.

Item 2.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
         Results of Operations

Results of Operations

Overview

Microsoft's business strategy emphasizes the development and sale of a broad
line of software products, including operating systems for personal computers
("PCs"), office machines, and personal information devices; application
programs; languages; and other hardware, book, and multimedia products.

Revenues for the third quarter of fiscal 1994 increased 30% over revenues for
the third quarter of fiscal 1993.  Revenues were $3.36 billion for the first
nine months of fiscal 1994, an increase of 24% over the comparable period of
the prior year.

Product Groups

Operating systems sales were $393 million in the third quarter of 1994,
compared to $313 million recorded in the same period of 1993.  Systems revenues
were $1.12 billion in the first nine months of 1994 compared to $854 million in
the first nine months of 1993, an increase of 31%.  Revenues generated by both
Microsoft MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows operating systems increased from the
prior year, particularly through the original equipment manufacturer ("OEM")
channel. During 1994, more than 80% of Windows units were sold through the
OEM channel.

Applications revenues were $798 million in the third quarter of 1994,
increasing 33% from $600 million in the third quarter of 1993.  For the first
three quarters of 1994, applications revenues were $2.08 billion, compared to
$1.68 billion in 1993.  Increases in applications revenues were led by sales of
Windows-based products, particularly Microsoft Office. Microsoft Office
Standard includes Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Word, a Microsoft Mail license,
and the Microsoft PowerPoint(R) presentation graphics program.  Microsoft
Office Professional for Windows includes all of the above plus the Microsoft
Access(R) database management program.  During the third quarter of 1994, the
Company released new Windows-based versions of Microsoft Office Standard and
Microsoft Office Professional, which contained the latest editions of Microsoft
Excel and Microsoft PowerPoint.

Hardware revenues were $53 million and $45 million in the third quarters of
1994 and 1993.  On a year-to-date basis, hardware revenues were $157 million in
1994 and $176 million in 1993.  The hardware product group's principal products
are the Microsoft Mouse and BallPoint(R) mouse pointing devices.  Mouse
revenues per unit are lower in the OEM channel than in the Company's retail
channels, and the percentage of mouse sales through the OEM channel increased
from the comparable quarter of the prior year.

Sales Channels

The Company has four major channels of distribution: OEM; U.S. and Canada;
Europe; and Other International.  OEM channel revenues are license fees from
original equipment manufacturers.  Sales in the retail channels are primarily
to distributors and resellers.

OEM revenues (primarily operating systems) grew 59% to $323 million from the
$203 million recorded in the comparable quarter of the prior year.  For the
first three quarters of 1994, OEM revenues were $846 million, compared to $514
million in the first three quarters of 1993.  MS-DOS continues to be
pre-installed on many PCs sold by original equipment manufacturers.  In
addition, many major OEMs are also preinstalling the Microsoft Windows
operating system on PCs, leading to increased revenues through the OEM channel.

Revenues in the U.S. and Canada were $381 million in the third quarter of 1994
compared to $322 million in 1993.  For the first three quarters of 1994,
revenues were $1.13 billion, compared to $975 million in 1993.

Revenues in Europe were $391 million in the third quarter of 1994 compared to
$335 million the prior year.  For the first three quarters, European revenues
were $989 million in 1994 and $963 million in 1993.

Other International channel revenues showed strong growth, increasing to $149
million in the third quarter of 1994 from $98 million in the third quarter of
1993.  Sales in Japan were particularly strong.  On a year-to-date basis, Other
International channel revenues grew 48%, to $389 million in 1994 from $262
million in 1993.

The Company's operating results are affected by foreign exchange rates.  Had
the exchange rates in effect during the third quarter of the prior year been in
effect during the third quarter of 1994, translated revenues would have been
approximately 2% higher in the third quarter of 1994.  Since much of the
Company's international manufacturing costs and operating expenses are incurred
in local currencies, the total impact of exchange rates on net income is less
than on revenues.





                                      6
<PAGE>   9
Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues decreased slightly to 16.7% in
the third quarter of 1994 from 16.8% in the third quarter of 1993.  On a
year-to-date basis, cost of revenues was 16.4% in 1994 and 16.7% in 1993.  Cost
of revenues varies with the channel mix and product mix within channels.

Research and development expenses increased 34% to $156 million, or
12.5% of revenues in the third quarter of 1994 from $116 million, or 12.1% of
revenues in the corresponding quarter of 1993.  For the first three quarters of
1994, research and development expenses represented 13.1% of revenues, compared
to 12.2% in 1993.  The increase in research and development expenses resulted
primarily from planned hiring of software developers and higher levels of
third-party development costs.

Sales and marketing expenses increased 15% to $359 million from $313 million in
the comparable quarter.  As a percentage of revenues, sales and marketing
expenses were 28.9% and 32.7% in the respective third quarters of 1994 and 1993
and 30.0% and 32.9% in the respective three quarters of 1994 and 1993.  The
increase in absolute amounts of sales and marketing expenses was primarily due
to increased marketing costs associated with the promotion of new products,
particularly Microsoft Office.

General and administrative expenses were 3.3% of revenues in the third quarter
of 1994 and 3.1% of revenues in the third quarter of 1993.

After a February 1994 jury verdict in the Stac Electronics lawsuit, the Company
recorded a one-time charge of $120 million.

Net interest income increased as a result of a larger investment portfolio
generated by cash from operations, offset by lower interest rates.  Other
expense did not fluctuate significantly.

The effective income tax rate was 33% in the third quarter of 1994, compared to
32% in 1993, reflecting newly enacted U.S. income tax laws.

Net income for the third quarter of 1994 was $256 million.  Excluding the
aforementioned one-time litigation charge, net income would have been $336
million, a 38% increase over the $243 million in the corresponding quarter of
1993.  Net income as a percentage of revenues was 20.6% in the third
quarter of 1994 (27.0% excluding the litigation charge), compared with 25.4% in
the third quarter of 1993.  On a year to date basis, net income as a percent of
revenues was 23.4% (25.7% excluding the litigation charge) in 1994 and
25.4% in 1993.

Financial Condition

The Company's cash and short-term investment portfolio totaled $3.14 billion at
March 31, 1994 and represented 64% of total assets.  The portfolio is
diversified among security types, industry groups, and individual issuers.  The
Company's investments are investment grade and liquid.  The portfolio, while
invested predominantly in U.S. dollar denominated securities, also includes
foreign currency positions in anticipation of continued international
expansion.

Microsoft has no material long-term debt. The Company has available $70 million
of standby multicurrency lines of credit.  These lines support foreign currency
hedging and international cash management.  Stockholders' equity at March 31,
1994 exceeded $4 billion.

Cash generated from operations has been sufficient to fund the Company's
investment in research and development activities and facilities expansion.  As
the Company grows, investments will continue in research and development in
existing and advanced areas of technology. Cash may also be used to acquire
technology or to fund strategic ventures.  Additions to property, plant, and
equipment are expected to continue, including new facilities and computer
systems for research and development; sales and marketing; product support; and
administrative staff.

The exercise of stock options by employees provides additional cash.  Funds
received have been used to repurchase the Company's common stock on the open
market to provide shares for stock option and stock purchase plans.  This
practice is continuing in 1994.

Management believes existing cash and short-term investments together with
funds generated from operations should be sufficient to meet the Company's
operating requirements for the next 12 months.
